Mine Sweeper in Flutter

# Get it here

- Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.metalrain.mine_sweeper
- Play on web: http://www.adamhammer.ca/minesweep

Note: Flutter web isn't super fast, so it's recommended to play in a small window
When you start a game, it'll create a grid based on the screen size, so bigger screen = more tiles
This can be difficult on a 2.5 or 4k screen for flutter web to handle.

This could be optimized to use a CustomPainter, but it would come with a lot of tradeoffs, and doesn't 
really show the "flutter way".

# Instructions

- Hit Play to start a game (if you resize windows, hit play to start a new game for that window)
- Change theme at will (this will not restart the game)
- Flag Tiles with long press
- Flag all the bombs and clear all the tiles to win
